## Thresholding Techniques for Image Segmentation

## Overview
This project demonstrates various **thresholding techniques** for image segmentation, a fundamental process in computer vision. Thresholding is a simple yet powerful way to separate foreground objects from the background in an image based on pixel intensity values. This README outlines the key techniques implemented, their functionality, and use cases.

## Features
The following thresholding techniques are implemented:
1. **Binary Thresholding**:
   - Pixels above the threshold are set to the maximum intensity (e.g., 255), and pixels below the threshold are set to 0.
   - Useful for creating binary masks of objects.

2. **Inverse Binary Thresholding**:
   - Similar to binary thresholding, but the intensity values are inverted (above threshold becomes 0, below becomes max value).

3. **Truncated Thresholding**:
   - Pixels above the threshold are set to the threshold value, and the rest remain unchanged.
   - Retains details in brighter regions while performing segmentation.

4. **Tozero Thresholding**:
   - Pixels below the threshold are set to 0, and the remaining pixels retain their original intensity values.
   - Highlights brighter regions of the image.

5. **Tozero Inverted Thresholding**:
   - Pixels above the threshold are set to 0, and the remaining pixels retain their original values.
   - Focuses on darker regions of the image.

6. **Otsu's Thresholding**:
   - Automatically calculates the optimal threshold value by analyzing the histogram of pixel intensities.
   - Ideal for images with bimodal histograms.

7. **Adaptive Thresholding**:
   - Dynamically computes the threshold value for smaller regions of the image, making it suitable for images with uneven lighting.
   - Types:
     - Adaptive Mean Thresholding: Uses the mean of the neighborhood pixel values.
     - Adaptive Gaussian Thresholding: Uses a weighted sum of pixel values based on a Gaussian distribution.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- NumPy (`numpy`)
- Matplotlib (`matplotlib`)

## Usage
1. Place your input image in the project directory.
2. Update the `image_path` variable in the script with the image's file name.
3. Run the script to apply the thresholding techniques:
```bash
python thresholding_techniques.py
```

## Output
For each thresholding technique:
1. The **original image**.
2. The **thresholded image** segmented using the specified technique.

Visualizations will be displayed using Matplotlib for comparison.

## Notes
- Adjust the `threshold_value` for binary and other thresholding techniques to explore different segmentation effects.
- Adaptive and Otsu's thresholding are dynamic methods and don't require manual threshold specification.

## Applications
Thresholding techniques are widely used for:
- Object detection and segmentation.
- Preprocessing in OCR (Optical Character Recognition).
- Medical image analysis.
- Industrial quality control.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement multi-level thresholding for more complex segmentation tasks.
- Extend to RGB images by applying thresholding to individual color channels.
- Combine thresholding techniques with morphological operations for enhanced segmentation.
